/*
 *
 * packet header
 * -------------
 * 31	sequence
 * 1	does this message contain a reliable payload
 * 31	acknowledge sequence
 * 1	acknowledge receipt of even/odd message
 * 8	qport
 *
 * The remote connection never knows if it missed a reliable message, the
 * local side detects that it has been dropped by seeing a sequence acknowledge
 * higher than the last reliable sequence, but without the correct even/odd
 * bit for the reliable set.
 *
 * If the sender notices that a reliable message has been dropped, it will be
 * retransmitted. It will not be retransmitted again until a message after
 * the retransmit has been acknowledged and the reliable still failed to get theve.
 *
 * if the sequence number is -1, the packet should be handled without a netcon
 *
 * The reliable message can be added to at any time by doing
 * Net_Write*(&netchan->message, <data>).
 *
 * If the message buffer is overflowed, either by a single message, or by
 * multiple frames worth piling up while the last reliable transmit goes
 * unacknowledged, the netchan signals a fatal error.
 *
 * Reliable messages are always placed first in a packet, then the unreliable
 * message is included if there is sufficient room.
 *
 * To the receiver, there is no distinction between the reliable and unreliable
 * parts of the message, they are just processed out as a single larger message.
 *
 * Illogical packet sequence numbers cause the packet to be dropped, but do
 * not kill the connection. This, combined with the tight window of valid
 * reliable acknowledgement numbers provides protection against malicious
 * address spoofing.
 *
 * The qport field is a workaround for bad address translating routers that
 * sometimes remap the client's source port on a packet during gameplay.
 *
 * If the base part of the net address matches and the qport matches, then the
 * channel matches even if the IP port differs. The IP port should be updated
 * to the new value before sending out any replies.
 *
 * If there is no information that needs to be transfered on a given frame,
 * such as during the connection stage while waiting for the client to load,
 * then a packet only needs to be delivered if there is something in the
 * unacknowledged reliable
